# _CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
You are applying a VISLZR UI cohesion patch into the user's repo.

GOAL
- Make VISLZR Canvas nodes + hints cohesive.
- Eliminate dynamic Tailwind class strings.

STEPS
1) Unzip the provided bundle.
2) Copy/merge `Canvas/` into the repo's Canvas component folder (typically `frontend/src/components/Canvas/`).
3) If the repo already contains `ui/` primitives, do NOT overwrite unless the user requests it. Otherwise, copy `ui/` into `frontend/src/components/ui/` (or equivalent).
4) Run repo checks:
   - lint, typecheck, dev build
5) Confirm visually:
   - Idea/Hypothesis/Insight/Task nodes share the same shell.
   - Selection ring is consistent.
   - TaskProgress node matches the node language.
   - InlineHint uses cc tokens (no gray-500 / blue-400 body text).
6) Commit with message: `VISLZR: unify Canvas node styling via NodeShell`
7) IMPORTANT: After applying, remove the zip file from the Downloads folder (per user preference).
